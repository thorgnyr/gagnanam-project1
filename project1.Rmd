```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We start by importing the data and looking at the attributes it contains.

```{r}
data <- read.table("data/winequality-red.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";", dec = ".")
str(data)
```

When we check the dataset we see that all of the attributes are numerical with good reason. We'll be making a C4.5 decision tree to try and predict how the wines get classified in terms of quality. Let's view the quality attribute a little closer.

```{r}
hist(data$quality)
levels(as.factor(data$quality))
```

The objective is to classify the items in the dataset correctly. More importantly, since we're all lovers of great wines, we'll make it a priority to classify the high quality wines over the other ones.
